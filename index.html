        <h2>Potatoes.</h2>
        <p>The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber
          of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself, a perennial in the
          family Solanaceae. Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas,
          from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed
          to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently
          in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety o
          f cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes.</p>

        <h2>How to Select and Store?</h2>
        <p>While potatoes are often conveniently packaged in a plastic bag, it is usually better to buy them individually from a bulk display. Not only will this allow you to better inspect the potatoes for signs of decay or damage, but many times, the plastic bags are not perforated and cause a build up of moisture that can negatively affect the potatoes.

          Potatoes should be firm, well shaped and relatively smooth, and should be free of decay that often manifests as wet or dry rot. In addition, they should not be sprouting or have green coloration since this indicates that they may contain the toxic alkaloid solanine that has been found to not only impart an undesirable taste, but can also cause a host of different health conditions such as circulatory and respiratory depression, headaches and diarrhea.

          Sometimes stores will offer already cleaned potatoes. These should be avoided since when their protective coating is removed by washing, potatoes are more vulnerable to bacteria. In addition, already cleaned potatoes are also more expensive, and since you will have to wash them again before cooking, you will be paying an unnecessary additional cost.

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>In 2016, world production of potatoes was 377 million tonnes, led by China with over 26% of the world total (see table). Other major producers were India, Russia, Ukraine and the United States. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially northern and eastern Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia.</p>
